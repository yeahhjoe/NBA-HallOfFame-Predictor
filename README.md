# Predicting NBA Hall of Famers: A Data Science Project

Welcome to my data science project that delves into the fascinating world of the NBA Hall of Famers and current players. In this project, I aimed to predict whether a current NBA player has the potential to become a Hall of Famer, based on an intricate analysis of their statistics and playing style. Here's an overview of the project's key steps and findings:

Project Overview:

Data Collection: The foundation of this project lies in the data. I obtained two critical datasets: one containing information about NBA Hall of Famers and the other comprising data on current NBA players.

Data Cleaning and Parsing: Cleaning is paramount to any data science project. I meticulously cleaned and parsed the two CSV files to ensure accurate and consistent data representation. This step involved handling missing values, data type conversions, and other preprocessing tasks.

Statistical Comparison: To unravel insights, I compared the statistics and play style of current NBA players with those of Hall of Famers. This comparative analysis shed light on the differences and similarities between the two groups.
Visualization: Visualizations are a powerful tool for conveying insights. I leveraged captivating visualizations to showcase the contrasting attributes of current players and Hall of Famers. These visual aids facilitated a deeper understanding of the data.

SQL Functions: SQL functions built into R proved instrumental in extracting the necessary information for robust data analysis. These functions enabled efficient querying of the data, aiding in drawing insightful conclusions.
Machine Learning Model: A highlight of this project is the creation of a custom machine learning model. This model employs key statistical indicators like points, rebounds, and assists to predict whether a current player is likely to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

Comparison and Evaluation: To validate the model's efficacy, I compared its predictions with the actual induction status of current NBA Hall of Famers. The model demonstrated an impressive accuracy rate of 86% in accurately predicting these cases.
